# Telecom-Commercial-Analytics
End-to-end Power BI analysis of telecom revenue volatility and data security risk management.

# **Project Overview**

This project analyzes a $456.12K monthly revenue base to identify drivers of customer attrition and data security vulnerabilities. By engineering a custom risk-assessment framework, this dashboard bridges the gap between commercial loss and regulatory compliance.

# **Key Insights**

- Revenue at Risk: Identified a 26.5% churn rate, primarily driven by month-to-month contracts.
- Retention Strategy: Quantified $121K in monthly revenue that could be stabilized through targeted contract optimization.
- Compliance Audit: Flagged 530 high-value churned accounts for PII (Personally Identifiable Information) retention review.
- Value Concentration: Discovered that 80.94% of the "High PII Risk" group are high-value customers with a premium $92.0 ARPU.

# **Technical Toolkit**

- Power BI: Advanced DAX for churn modeling and ARPU calculations.
- Power Query (M): Custom conditional logic for customer segmentation and security risk flagging.
- SQL: Data validation and cleaning of telecom usage records.
